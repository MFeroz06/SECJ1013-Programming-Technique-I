- To build strong teamwork and collaboration within the group.
## 🎯 Mission
- To build BMR Calculator with C++
- To work together effectively to complete all assigned tasks.

## Instruction
> Develop a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator to estimate a basal metabolic rate: the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment, and in a post-absorptive state (meaning that the digestive system is inactive, which requires about 12 hours of fasting).

## ✨ Reflection
---
> This improve my technical skill which is C++ coding.
---

## ✨ Suggestion for Improvement
---
> I hope we can create a real calculator that applies our coding.
